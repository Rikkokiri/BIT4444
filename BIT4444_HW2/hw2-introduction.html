          The Business Information Technology (BIT) Department offers two degree options for its undergraduate major in Business Information Technology:
        </p>

        <ul class="no-markers-list">
          <li id="DSS_title">
            <a href="introduction.html#dss-heading">Decision Support Systems (DSS)</a>

            <a href= "introduction.html#osm-heading">Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSM)</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Both options are focused on learning how to effectively use computers and analytical
          problem-solving techniques to support decision-making in a business environment. The
          differencies and similarities between this two degree options are described more in-depth on
          <a href="comparison.html">DSM &amp; OSM comparison page.</a>

      <div class="dss">
        <h2 id="dss-heading">Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h2>

        <p class="program-description">
          The decision support systems option educates the student in  <strong>the design, implementation and
          use of computerized systems</strong> that support  business managers in the decision-making process. A
          decision support system  (DSS) is a computer system that typically encompasses mathematical
          models as  well as informational databases and a user interface in order to provide  recommended
          decisions to manager-users. A DSS differs from a traditional  information system (IS) or
          management information system (MIS) in that it not  only provides the user with information,
          databases or reports, as does an IS or  MIS, but it also provides answers to user queries, i.e.,
          decisions, through its  modeling component. In essence a DSS is a computer system that helps
          managers  make decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="program-description">
          Students in the DSS option take a variety of specialized
          courses in the information technology field that enhances their ability to  develop computer
          decision support systems. Course topics include information  systems, database management,
          networks and telecommunications, security,  decision support system development and
          implementation, visual interface  design, artificial intelligence, client/server systems,
          internet systems  development, and simulation as well as various mathematical modeling
          techniques. Specific computing language skills include C++, Visual Basic  (VB.net) and JAVA.
        </p>
        <p class="program-description">
          The  job market for graduates of the DSS option is excellent. <em>Over 100 companies and
          government organizations annually interview BIT seniors.</em> DSS graduates typically  obtain jobs in
          the information technology field.

      <div class="osm">
        <h2 id="osm-heading"> Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSM) </h2>

        <p class="program-description">
          The operations and supply chain management (OSM) option is designed to teach our students how
          to <strong>manage operations in business and government</strong>. An operation is the process by which a
          company or organization converts raw materials, labor and capital into a final product or
          service. In an automobile company, for example, materials and labor are transformed by
          manufacturing operations into cars. In a hospital, nurses and doctors use medicines, care and
          equipment to help sick patients become healthy. In a bank, staff members use computers and
          systems to manage the flow of money among accounts and provide customers with statements and
          other banking services. Whatever the operation, decisions have to be made to establish work
          schedules for employees, forecast demand for products and services, improve and maintain
          quality, ensure adequate inventory, transport and store products and materials, and order
          materials and parts. These all require operational decisions that can be made using the
          managerial techniques and computing technologies taught in the OSM option of our major.
        </p>
        <p class="program-description">
          Students in the OSM option take a variety of specialized courses in the operations and supply
          chain management field that prepare them to become operations and supply chain managers or
          perform as staff members in operations functions. Course topics focus on supply chain
          management and also include planning and control, logistics, quality management, scheduling,
          inventory control, forecasting, project management, product and service design, facility
          layout and process planning. OSM option majors are also taught computer and IT skills that
          will aid them in managing operations in todayâ€™s high-technology business environment.
        </p>
        <p class="program-description">
          <em>The job opportunities for OSM option graduates are also excellent.</em> There is a general shortage
          of qualified graduates in the operations management area, thus our OSM option graduates are in
          high-demand. OSM option graduates are sometimes hired directly into management positions but
          most frequently they are hired into management or staff training positions. Following training
          OSM majors are typically placed into supervisory or department head positions wherein they
          manage and oversee specific company operations. Alternatively they may be placed into staff
          positions where they are involved with company-wide operational decisions.
