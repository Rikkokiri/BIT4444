        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Department of Business and Information Technology (BIT) offers two degree options for
          undergraduate major in Business and Information Technology: The Decision Support Systems (DSS)<wbr />
          and The Operations and Supply Chain Management. These options have many similar as both
          options are focused on learning how to effectively use computers and analytical
          problem-solving techniques to support decision-making in a business environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are also some distinct differences between DSS and OSM degree options. The purpose of
          this page is to compare the two options and clarify both their similarities and
          differencies. The main goal is guide future BIT students as they consider studying BIT and
          choose between these two degree options.

        <h2>What are the differences between the two BIT options - DSS and OSM?</h2>


        <section class="dss-desc">
          <h3>The Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h3>
          <p>
            The Decision Support Systems (DSS) option is the largest of our two BIT
            options with approximately 70 percent of our majors. It focuses on teaching our majors how
            to develop computer systems that will help businesses and managers solve problems; e.g.,
            systems development. As such, it is very applications oriented; i.e., the application of
            information and computer technology to solving practical business problems. Computer systems
            developed to solve such business problems often require the use of mathematical models.It is
            a very computer-intensive degree program that includes information technology tools such as
            networks and telecommunications, computer simulation, computer programming, database
            management, security, information systems, client/server applications, visual interface
            design, object-oriented systems <wbr /> and Internet and e-business systems.

        <section class="osm-desc">
          <h3>The Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSM)</h3>
          <p>
            The Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSM) option is the smaller of
            our two options with about 30 percent of our majors. All organizations, business or
            otherwise, have "operations", the business processes that get things done in an
            organization. The US Department of Labor has listed operations management as one of the top
            ten growing occupations in this decade. This option teaches students to occupy management
            positions in operations, often in a departmental or supervisory position, or in a staff
            position. Topics in this option focus on supply chain management and include quality control
            and process improvement, enterprise planning and control, logistics, inventory control,
            scheduling, resource allocation, production planning and project management. It is less
            computer-intensive than our other two options, yet it still uses computers and information
            technology for the analysis and solution of operational problems.

          As stated above, students are not divided equally between two degree options. DSS is far
          bigger major, about 70% of student opting for DSS. This student distribution is
          demonstrated in figure below.

          <h3>DSS Job Opportunies</h3>
          <p>
            <mark>The job market for graduates of the DSS option is excellent.</mark> Over 100 companies and
            government organizations annually interview BIT seniors. DSS graduates typically obtain
            jobs in the information technology field. Job titles include consultant, technical
            consultant, systems analyst, systems developer, network administrator, management analyst,
            programmer analyst, project analyst, database developer, software developer, programming
            consultant, information manager, applications developer, and information management
            consultant, among many others. The largest single type of employer of DSS option graduates
            is typically consulting firms .  However, numerous other types
            of companies and organizations hire DSS graduates to work in various IT-related jobs.

          <h3>OSM Job Opportunities</h3>
          <p>
            <mark>The job opportunities for OM option graduates are also excellent.</mark> There is a general
            shortage of qualified graduates in the operations management area, thus our OM option
            graduates are in high-demand. OM option graduates are sometimes hired directly into
            management positions but most frequently they are hired into management or staff training
            positions. Following training OM majors are typically placed into supervisory or
            department head positions where they manage and oversee specific company operations.
            Alternatively they may be placed into staff positions where they are involved with
            company-wide operational decisions.
